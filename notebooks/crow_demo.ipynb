A study evaluating the use of 180 µg/mL rhNGF eye drops in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) included 60 participants who underwent 8 weeks of treatment followed by a 24-week follow-up. The results demonstrate that rhNGF had good safety and tolerability, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. However, in the short term, it did not achieve significant neuroenhancement effects. Nevertheless, functional and structural measures showed a non-significant trend favoring rhNGF, suggesting its potential neuroprotective role [32]. Another potential drug, citicoline, has been widely studied for its neuroprotective effects in glaucoma. Numerous studies have shown that citicoline can reduce RGC loss and improve visual field performance, VEPs, and PERG while preserving\n",

Among these, the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has become a focal point in glaucoma neuroprotection research due to its ability to promote neuronal survival, repair, and regeneration [ 29]. A Phase I clinical trial by Goldberg et al. further supported this perspective [ 30]. The trial involved 11 patients with POAG, with one eye receiving the CNTF-secreting NT-501 implant while the other eye served as a control. Over an 18-month follow-up, NT-501 demonstrated good safety, with only mild postoperative foreign body sensations that were resolved within 12 weeks. Importantly, the implanted eyes showed positive outcomes in both function and structure, including stabilized visual acuity, slight improvements in contrast sensitivity, and a significant increase in RNFL thickness.

      "MEDICINE Pathophysiology The retinal ganglion cells are neurons of the central ner - vous system that receive signals from the photoreceptors, process them, and transmit them in axons through the optic nerve to further centers in the brain. These axons run from the ganglion cell nuclei in the retina to the optic disc (2), and then together with the retinal vessels through the lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like structure composed of collagen. Behind the lamina cribrosa, the axons, sur- rounded by a myelin sheath, continue as the optic nerve. Elevated intraocular pressure, low perfusion pressure, and/or low cerebrospinal fluid pressure increase the gradient across the lamina cribrosa and cause papillary hypoperfusion, leading to structural changes and re - modeling of the lamina cribrosa and to impaired axonal transport in the optic nerve fibers (4). In particular, the pores in the anterior region of the lamina cribrosa are elongated in open-angle glaucoma (5). The increasing loss of retinal\n",

      "Biomedicines 2025, 13, 850 5 of 11 Animal studies have shown that rhNGF activates the TrkA receptor and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, reducing apoptosis and promoting neuronal regeneration, thereby protecting RGCs [31]. A study evaluating the use of 180 µg/mL rhNGF eye drops in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) included 60 participants who underwent 8 weeks of treatment followed by a 24-week follow-up. The results demonstrate that rhNGF had good safety and tolerability, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. However, in the short term, it did not achieve significant neuroenhancement effects. Nevertheless, functional and structural measures showed a non-significant trend favoring rhNGF, suggesting its potential neuroprotective role [32]. Another potential drug, citicoline, has been widely studied for its neuroprotective effects in glaucoma. Numerous studies have shown that citicoline can reduce RGC loss and improve visual field performance, VEPs, and PERG while preserving\u001b[00m\n",
