    "analysis": "Both assays are well-designed and have strong biomedical rationale. The Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Assay is more mechanistically focused, investigating the role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in axonal degeneration. In contrast, the Neurotrophic Factor Signaling Activation assay is more therapeutically focused, exploring the neuroprotective effects of neurotrophic factors. Both assays have previous use in similar contexts and strong biomedical evidence supporting their relevance to glaucoma.",
    "reasoning": "The Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Assay is a more mechanistically driven approach, which may provide deeper insights into the underlying biology of glaucoma. While both assays have high potential, the Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Assay is more likely to identify novel therapeutic targets.",
