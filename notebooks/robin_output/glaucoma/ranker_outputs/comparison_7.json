    "analysis": "Both assays demonstrate strong scientific merit, experimental design, and biomedical rationale. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin Pathway Modulation assay targets a well-established signaling pathway in retinal ganglion cell biology, with robust evidence supporting its role in cell survival and axonal growth. The MMP Activity and Blood-Aqueous Barrier Integrity Assay also investigates a well-defined biological process, with MMP-9 implicated in glaucoma and blood-aqueous barrier disruption. Both assays leverage relevant in vitro models and have been previously used in similar contexts.",
    "reasoning": "While both assays are methodologically sound, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin Pathway Modulation assay is preferred due to its more direct relevance to retinal ganglion cell biology and the stronger evidence supporting its role in cell survival and axonal growth.",
